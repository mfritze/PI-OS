# PI OS
A project of creating an operating system for the raspberry pi. Currently following this [tutorial](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/os/). Upon completion, further changes will be made.

## How To Run
Currently not self-sufficient. With a working operating system on your pi (such as raspbian), rename the old kernal.img file. In the root directory of this repo, call make, then copy the newly creaty kernal.img file to the SD card.
